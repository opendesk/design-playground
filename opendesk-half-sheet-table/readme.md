[Half Sheet Table]( https://www.opendesk.cc/zero/half-sheet-table ) is designed by [Lynton Pepper]( https://www.opendesk.cc/designers/lynton-pepper ) who works with
[00]( http://www.project00.cc/ ) in London, England. The design was featured in [Wired Magazine]( http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2015/01/play/download-this-table )
in November 2014.

Of the many OpenDesk designs, this one has perhaps the most complex cutouts. 
The cutouts help make the design look and feel as one of the lightest, most airy designs in the range.

### Features

* Highly parameterized
	* With real-time updates
* Zoom, pan and rotate in 3D

### Issues

This is a work in progress still at an early stage

* Mobile device
	* Model displays and allows zoom, pan and rotate
	* But does not respond to parameter changes
* Leg crossbar not included
* Table top slots rudimentary and incomplete
* Table legs missing slots and various details
* Slots that are required to be non-perpendicular to surface have not yet been developed
	* Angled slots may be tricky, but as of this writing we think it can be done
* Incomplete and rudimentary positioning of legs
* Intersect parameter makes arbitrary, unnecessary changes
* Construction lines visible
